                    <p>
                        The primary objective of the Integrated Academic Insights Portal (IAIP) is to develop a centralized, data-driven platform for educational institutions. The portal aims to consolidate disparate academic data sources—including student demographics, course information, faculty assignments, attendance records, and assessment results—into a single, cohesive system. This will empower administrators, faculty, and academic advisors with actionable insights to enhance student outcomes, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall institutional effectiveness.

                    <p>
                        The system's database schema is designed around several core entities: <strong>Students</strong>, <strong>Faculty</strong>, <strong>Courses</strong>, <strong>Departments</strong>, <strong>Enrollments</strong>, <strong>Attendance</strong>, and <strong>Assessments</strong>.

                        <li><strong>Students</strong> have a one-to-many relationship with <strong>Enrollments</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Courses</strong> also have a one-to-many relationship with <strong>Enrollments</strong>, creating a many-to-many relationship between Students and Courses, resolved by the Enrollments entity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Faculty</strong> have a one-to-many relationship with <strong>Courses</strong> (an instructor teaches many courses).</li>
                        <li><strong>Departments</strong> have a one-to-many relationship with both <strong>Faculty</strong> and <strong>Courses</strong>.</li>

                    <p>
                        All relations in the database schema have been normalized to Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF). This was achieved by ensuring that for every non-trivial functional dependency X → Y, X is a superkey of the relation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, in the <strong>Enrollments</strong> relation with attributes (<u>StudentID</u>, <u>CourseID</u>, Semester, Grade), the primary key is a composite of {`StudentID, CourseID`}. All non-key attributes like `Semester` and `Grade` are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key. There are no dependencies where a part of the key determines a non-key attribute, nor are there any dependencies where a non-key attribute determines another non-key attribute. This decomposition prevents data redundancy and avoids update, insertion, and deletion anomalies, ensuring data integrity across the platform.
